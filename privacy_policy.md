## Pocket Mirror: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Pocket Mirror app for Android & iOS!

As an avid Android and iOS user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. The app will only use your camera as your privacy concern when opening the app
for the first time.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Gregorius Yuristama.
